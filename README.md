# Doing a Master Thesis on Applied Machine Learning

Do you have some topic, application or research question that you would like to explore during a master thesis? If you think that machine learning 
methods could be useful for your thesis you might consider having [me](https://alexjungaalto.github.io/) as your thesis supervisor. 

# What can you expect from me as your thesis supervisor ?

My main technical expertise is on optimization theory and methods for machine learning (ML) from network structured data. Some recent papers can be 
found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12769) and <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9298875" target="__blank">here</a>. 

Another recent focus of my research is the application of information theory to explainable machine learning. We have introduced a quantitative measure 
for subjective explainability of predictions <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9089200" target="__blank">in this paper</a>
and used it to regularize the training of any given ML model  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01492" target="_blank">in this paper</a>. 

Beside the above research threads I am also passionate to learn about novel and important applications of basic ML methods. I am 
happy to help you make good use of existing ML methods or develop novel techniques that are tailored to your specific topic. 

If you choose to work with me as your supervisor, you will be added to our group mailing list and receive invitations to our 
regular group meetings. During these meetings you have the opportunity to present your work, get feedback 
from other group members and also see what they are working on. You will also be added to our discussion forum (currently 
in the form of slack) to ask questions and look for help. 

# The Start 

In general, the start of your thesis is to come up with a formulation of your topic as a ML problem. This formulation amounts to 
explaining (the meaning of) data points, their features and label. You should also think about one or two potential ML models that 
you are familiar with (e.g., you can implement them using a programming language such as Python). Beside the choice of 
data and model, you should also think about possible performance criteria or loss functions that are used to evaluate the usefulness 
of a (trained) model. You can read more about these design choices (for data, model and loss) in Chapter 2 of my textbook <a href="https://primo.aalto.fi/discovery/openurl?institution=358AALTO_INST&vid=358AALTO_INST:VU1&ctx_enc=info:ofi%2FencUTF-8&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi%2Fkev:fmt:book&rft.pub=Springer&ctx_tim=2023-08-06T18:10:37EEST&rft_id=info:doi%2F10.1007%2F978-981-16-8193-6&rfr_id=info:sid%2Fpure.atira.dk:pure&ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft.isbn=978-981-16-8192-9&rft.btitle=Machine%20Learning&rft.genre=book&rft.aufirst=Alex&url_ctx_fmt=info:ofi%2Ffmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft.aulast=Jung&url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft.auinit=A&rft.date=2022" target="_blank">here</a>.

# Working on the Thesis 

The main thesis work might consist of several iterations of data gathering, model selection, training and diagnosis. Each 
of these steps requires different skills and programming libraries, e.g., Python packages [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data gathering and processing and  
[`scikit-learn`]() for ML model selection, training and diagnosis. 
During the iterations you might want to reflect on your design choices and diagnoses by trying to answer the peer grading questions 
used for the student project in [CS-C3240 Machine Learning](CS_C3240_PeerReview.pdf) and [CS-E4740 Federated Learning](CS_E4740_PeerReview.pdf).

Beside the actual design and implementation of ML methods and numerical experiments, another main component of the thesis work is the actual 
writing of the thesis manuscript. To get started on the writing, you might use a template for project reports used in some of my ML courses [CS-C3240 
Machine Learning](https://github.com/alexjungaalto/FederatedLearning/blob/main/material/FederatedLearningPaper.pdf) and [CS-E4740 Federated Learning](https://github.com/alexjungaalto/FederatedLearning/blob/main/material/FederatedLearningPaper.pdf). However, 
these templates are meant as a support wheel and not as a fill-out form. 

# The Finish Line  

When you have completed the writing of the thesis (draft), I will ask you to prepare a self-assessment of your thesis. This self-assessment 
amounts to filling out the evaluation form [here](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/pluginfile.php/1785438/mod_resource/content/1/thesis-statement-template-CCIS-SCI.pdf) 
that I will also use to evaluate your thesis. Your self-assessment should take into account the typical grade characterizations 
<a href="https://mycourses.aalto.fi/pluginfile.php/569812/course/section/105302/Typical%20characterization%20of%20theses%20grades_SCI_20161213.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> 
and include sufficient justifications. These justifications should be as specific as possible and use references to the relevant locations of your thesis.
