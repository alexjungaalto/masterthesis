# Doing a Master Thesis on Applied Machine Learning

This site provides an info package for students who are about to start working on their master thesis. 

# What can I offer to you as Thesis Supervisor ?

My main expertise is on optimization theory and methods for machine learning (ML) from network structured data. Some recent papers can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12769) and 
[here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9298875). Another recent focus of my research is the application of information theory to explainable machine learning. We have introduced a 
quantitative measure for subjective explainability of predictions [in this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9089200) and used it to regularize machine learning models [in this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01492). 

# The Start 

In general, the start of your thesis is to come up with a formulation of your topic as a ML problem. This formulation amounts to explaining (the meaning of) data points, their features and label. 
You should also think about one or two potential ML models that you are familiar with (e.g., you can implement them using a programming language such as Python). Beside the choice of 
data and model, you should also think about possible performance criteria or loss functions that are used to evaluate the usefulness of a (trained model). You can read more about these 
design choices (for data, model and loss) in Chapter 2 of my textbook [here](https://primo.aalto.fi/discovery/openurl?institution=358AALTO_INST&vid=358AALTO_INST:VU1&ctx_enc=info:ofi%2FencUTF-8&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi%2Fkev:fmt:book&rft.pub=Springer&ctx_tim=2023-08-06T18:10:37EEST&rft_id=info:doi%2F10.1007%2F978-981-16-8193-6&rfr_id=info:sid%2Fpure.atira.dk:pure&ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft.isbn=978-981-16-8192-9&rft.btitle=Machine%20Learning&rft.genre=book&rft.aufirst=Alex&url_ctx_fmt=info:ofi%2Ffmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft.aulast=Jung&url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft.auinit=A&rft.date=2022).
