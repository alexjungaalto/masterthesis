### üß≠ Motivation

We Europeans are fortunate to live in democratic societies where we can choose our political leaders. But what are the real-world consequences of our choices? And on the flip side, what influences the decisions we make at the ballot box?

This thesis explores the interconnection between political preferences and aspects of everyday life, with a focus on public health behavior during and after the Covid-19 pandemic. Specifically, it investigates whether and how vaccination rates across Austrian municipalities relate to voting outcomes in elections held during and after the pandemic.

### ‚ùì Research Questions

- How are Covid-19 vaccination rates across Austrian municipalities correlated with election results during the pandemic (e.g., 2020‚Äì2021)?
- How did these patterns evolve in elections held after the height of the pandemic?
- To what extent do socioeconomic and regional factors mediate or explain the relationship between public health behavior and political preferences?

### üß™ Methodology

This thesis takes a **data-driven approach**, combining:

- Exploratory data analysis and statistical modeling
- Geospatial visualization and clustering of municipalities
- Regression analysis and hypothesis testing
- (Optional) Causal inference techniques such as matching or instrumental variables

Tools: Python, pandas, geopandas, matplotlib, seaborn

### üìä Main Data Source

The primary source of data for this thesis is [**data.gv.at**](https://data.gv.at/en/), Austria‚Äôs official open government data platform. This portal provides access to:

- Covid-19 vaccination rates at the municipality level
- Electoral outcomes from national and regional elections
- Demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related data
- Geospatial boundary files (shapefiles) for visualization and analysis

Other sources (such as Statistik Austria and Eurostat) may be used to enrich the dataset when necessary.

### üéØ Expected Outcomes

The thesis aims to uncover whether political choices and health behaviors are intertwined in measurable, spatially localized ways. The results could inform discussions around public trust, political polarization, and health communication in democratic societies.

### ‚úÖ Recommended Background

This thesis is suitable for students interested in:

- Data science, political science, or public policy
- Applied statistics and data analysis
