# Doing a Master Thesis on Applied Machine Learning

Applied machine learning (ML) transforms data into meaningful insights across domainsâ€”from healthcare and finance to climate science and beyond. If you're interested in exploring a research question or application using ML, consider having [me](https://machinelearningforall.github.io/about/) as your thesis supervisor.

You can find a list of master theses currently supervised by me [here](material/MasterThesisSupervisedCurrent.pdf).

You can find potential topics for a master thesis [here](Topics)

## What can you expect from me as your supervisor?

As your supervisor, you can expect me to:

- Help you clearly define your ML problem.
- Advise you on suitable ML methods, tools, and resources.
- Provide regular feedback during our group meetings.
- Guide you through thesis writing and evaluation.



### My Research Interests

My expertise includes:

- **Networked data analysis:** Leveraging relational structures in data ([recent example](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12769)).
- **Explainable ML:** Using information theory to measure and improve interpretability ([example paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9089200)).
- **Applied ML:** Exploring novel and impactful applications of ML techniques.

I'm also open to supervising projects outside these areas if the topic is exciting and well-defined.

## Getting Started

To start your thesis:

1. **Formulate your ML problem** clearly ([watch this video](https://youtu.be/2q5jpvD-638)).
2. **Choose suitable ML models** you're comfortable implementing (e.g., linear regression, neural networks).
3. **Identify data sources, features, and evaluation criteria** (e.g., test accuracy, computational efficiency).

You can find detailed guidance in [Chapter 2 of my textbook](https://primo.aalto.fi/discovery/openurl?institution=358AALTO_INST&vid=358AALTO_INST:VU1&ctx_enc=info:ofi%2FencUTF-8&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi%2Fkev:fmt:book&rft.pub=Springer&rft_id=info:doi%2F10.1007%2F978-981-16-8193-6).

Additionally, I've prepared [lecture videos on these topics](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrbn2dGrLJK9zB7pdEd8QOtmC9-eoqoch).

## Practical Workflow

Your thesis typically involves iterative steps of:

- **Data collection and preprocessing** using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).
- **Model selection, training, and evaluation** using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/).

To validate your methods, consider reviewing peer-grading guidelines used in:

- [Machine Learning course](material/CS_C3240_PeerReview.pdf)
- [Federated Learning course](material/CS_E4740_PeerReview.pdf)

## Thesis Manuscript Preparation

When preparing your thesis, ensure:

- The ML problem is precisely defined (data, features, labels).  
  *(Check definitions using the [Aalto Dictionary of ML](https://aaltodictionaryofml.github.io/))*.
- Your results are thoroughly analyzed and clearly presented.
- Appropriate baselines or benchmarks are used (e.g., [Kaggle competitions](https://kaggle.com)).
- Chapters and sections are clearly structured, with introductory paragraphs explaining content and connections.
- Equations, figures, and tables are consistently referenced using LaTeX commands (`\ref{}`, `\eqref{}`).
- New methods are presented as pseudocode ([see examples](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Algorithms)).
- Figures are clear, labeled, and have informative captions ([guidelines](https://www.scu.edu/media/offices/provost/writing-center/resources/Tips-Figure-Captions.pdf)).
- References are formatted according to the [IEEE guidelines](https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/IEEE_Reference_Guide.pdf).

For guidance on creating effective and visually appealing figures, consider consulting Edward Tufte's classic 
book ["The Visual Display of Quantitative Information"](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi).

## Iterative Writing Process

Expect multiple iterations on your manuscript:

- Write your first draft quickly to capture your main ideas.
- Regularly incorporate feedback from peers, group meetings, or even LLM tools.
- Consider writing non-linearly, starting from results or discussion and working backwards to the introduction.

## Final Thesis Checklist

Before submitting your thesis, verify:

- [ ] Clear problem formulation
- [ ] Methods clearly described, including pseudocode
- [ ] Clear figures with labeled axes and informative captions
- [ ] All equations, tables, and figures referenced in the text
- [ ] Citations formatted correctly
- [ ] Self-assessment form completed ([form here](material/Statement_template_CCIS.docx))

## Thesis Evaluation and Presentation

Upon completion:

- Complete a detailed self-assessment ([evaluation form](material/Statement_template_CCIS.docx)), clearly referencing sections of your thesis.
- Review the [grade characterization PDF](material/GradeCharact.pdf) for guidance on what constitutes a high-quality thesis.
- Prepare your thesis presentation (live during a group meeting or as a recorded video; see [examples here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrbn2dGrLJK8xt7j0tvaL0uMCdrtQ7JY2)).
